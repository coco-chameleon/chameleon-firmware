# CoCo Chameleon Firmware

The CoCo Chameleon is a cartridge which emulates other cartridges for
the Tandy TRS-80 Color Computer line of home computers from the 1980s.
It supports all three versions of the CoCo and should be able to
replicate the computer-facing behavior of nearly any other cartridge.

This repository contains the firmware which runs on the CoCo Chameleon.

### Espressif System Libraries

When this application is compiled into an executable image, depending
on which features are enabled at compile time, that image may include
object code for certain non-free libraries maintained by Espressif and
distributed in object code form only as part of ESP-IDF (the software
development kit for the ESP32-S3 system-on-module). Those libraries are
currently necessary to use the module's RF hardware.

It is our view as the authors of this application that such non-free
libraries which are part of ESP-IDF constitute System Libraries under
the terms of the GPL (version 3), and therefore their inclusion in
the object code form of this application does not create a conflict
with the terms of the GPL when that object code form is conveyed.
